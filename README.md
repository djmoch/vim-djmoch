# vim-djmoch

My own, personal colorscheme.

## Description

If you're looking for a beautiful colorscheme for Vim with beautiful,
well-balanced colors, then you should look elsewhere. If you want a
dark, low-contrast theme for your editor, this isn't for you. If you
want something that the author _didn't_ just name after himself, then
I'm sorry.

The several goals of __vim-djmoch__ are as follows:

1. High contrast, for readability.
2. Black-on-white, which is more natural to the eye.
3. I'm somewhat attached to the shade of blue, so that's used as an
   accent.

Beyond those goals, the author reserves every right to make sudden,
radical changes without warning. The hope is that it will stabilize over
time, but as of September 2019 it's brand new and should be considered
unstable (or worse).
